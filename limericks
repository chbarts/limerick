A businessman felt morbid fear
Of cocktails, sloe gin, and beer.
   When passing a bar
   He'd speed up his car
So the spirits couldn't get near.

A countess (quite drunk on gin)
Thought sneezing would help her stay thin.
   She made quite a bouquet
   Out of ragweed and hay
But was horribly cut up by whin.

A lexicographer took his repose
In a place that only he knows.
   Down by the roots
   Of old antique Teut's:
An obscure Germanic doze.

A woman, dripping with smarm
Took insincere hold of my arm.
   Saying "Oh, but you must... "
   And "Isn't he just!"
I'm thinking of doing her harm.

Young Cowper didn't seem able
To jump over the fancy end-table.
   But with a loud yawp
   He vaulted the top
... his bruise is now a deep sable.
