A businessman felt morbid fear
Of cocktails, sloe gin, and beer.
   When passing a bar
   He'd speed up his car
So the spirits couldn't get near.

A countess (quite drunk on gin)
Thought sneezing would help her stay thin.
   She made quite a bouquet
   Out of ragweed and hay
But was horribly cut up by whin.

A lexicographer took his repose
In a place that only he knows.
   Down by the roots
   Of old antique Teut's:
An obscure Germanic doze.
